## About me!
**ðŸ‘‹ Howdy!**, my name is Raymond G. Fischer, though you can call me Ray-Ray. 
I'm an enthusiastic gamer and dedicated artist with a passion for coding.
Currently, I'm the CEO of RedLightStudio, Co., an indie company that specializes in 2D/3D animation.
When I'm not immersed in the gaming world or working on my art, you'll often find me crafting innovative projects at RedLightStudio.
Welcome to my world of creativity and technology! :heart::heart::heart:
## About RedLightStudio!
I founded the studio in 2017, initially with a focus on game development.
However, in 2020, we made a strategic transition to emphasize our expertise in the artistic aspects of the industry.
This shift allowed us to explore new creative horizons and expand our portfolio.
At RedLightStudio, we're dedicated to blending artistry and technology to create captivating 2D/3D animations and other exciting projects. :thinking::thinking::thinking:
### Thank you!
Don't worry, I have some awesome projects in the works, though it's tough not to get burned out :face_exhaling:, welp :neutral_face:, come back at a later date and I might have added something cool, thank you, and see ya soon! :sunflower::sunflower::sunflower:
